Angular 2 latest package versions link:

package.json notes:

"scripts": {
    "start": "tsc && concurrently \"tsc -w\" \"lite-server\" ",
    "lite": "lite-server",
    "postinstall": "typings install && gulp restore",
    "tsc": "tsc", <!-- tsc is keyword for TypeScript -->
    "tsc:w": "tsc -w",
    "typings": "typings"
  }

Gulpfile.js is very important here because we require the "node_modules" folder to be copied into the wwwroot which is where all the requests are served with

systemjs.config.js allows the Systemjs framework to load up our "app" directory which is where the typescript files are


==============
TYPINGS
================

typings.json has to be on the root of the application
When added into the project, navigate to application in file explorer, open cmd and type "npm install typings -g"

as well as that, sometimes the typings files under typings folder may complain that some code is missing meaning that other typings file are required

e.g. for jQuery typings - typings install dt~jquery --global
